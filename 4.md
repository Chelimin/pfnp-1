# Putting It All Together
Our app has been split into two: front-end and back-end.

- The **front-end** requires a series of build steps to lint, test, and transpile our HTML/CSS/JS source code.

  Location: `/frontend`

- The **back-end** is a web service that runs continuously and also serves the front-end assets from the *dist* folder.

  Location: `/backend`

We also have two environments: **development** and **production**.

- During development we want to make our lives easier by exposing a debugging interace and watching for source code file changes to automatically re-run the build, lint, and other steps.
- The production environment is deployed to our public web server. We want to create as lean an environment as possible to achieve optimal performance.

## Starting and configuring the application
Using **NPM** and the `scripts` field of the `package.json` file, we have declared all the necessary command line instructions. This allows us to customise the build tool chain while maintaining a simple, consistent interface.

### Development Environment
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Environment
```bash
npm start
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)
```bash
npm test
```
**Note:** The CI build runs on cloud services like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Codeship](https://codeship.com/), or [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/). They help teams collaborate and act as a final check to prevent deploying broken builds.
