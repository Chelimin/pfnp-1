# Putting It All Together
Our app has been split into two: front-end and back-end.

- The **front-end** requires a series of build steps to lint, test, and transpile our HTML/CSS/JS source code.

  Location: `/frontend`

- The **back-end** is a web service that runs continuously and also serves the front-end assets from the *dist* folder.

  Location: `/backend`

We also have two environments: **development** and **production**.

- During development we want to make our lives easier by exposing a debugging interace and watching for source code file changes to automatically re-run the build, lint, and other steps.
- The production environment is deployed to our public web server. We want to create as lean an environment as possible to achieve optimal performance.

## Starting and configuring the application
Using **NPM** and the `scripts` field of the `package.json` file, we have declared all the necessary command line instructions. This allows us to customise the build tool chain while maintaining a simple, consistent interface.

### Development Environment
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Environment
```bash
npm start
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)
```bash
npm test
```
**Note:** The CI build runs on cloud services like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Codeship](https://codeship.com/), or [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/). They help teams collaborate and act as a final check to prevent deploying broken builds.

## Creating database tables

For this MVP we can simply load data from a JSON file.
```js
import database from './database.json'
```

See: [database.json](./backend/database.json)

The database **schema** defines the structure of the database contents. Each Friend object has two properties of a specific type.

```js
{
  id: Number,
  name: String
}
```

## Building the controller

The [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework builds upon Node.js' built-in `http` module. It offers the routing capability we need to implement the RESTful APIs.

```js
import express from 'express'
const app = express()
```

Then let's set up some routes. Listing out all friends:
```js
app.get('/friends', (req, res) => {
  res.json(database)
})
```

Looking up a specific friend:
```js
app.get('/friends/:id', (req, res) => {
  const byId = ({id}) => id === +req.params.id
  const result = database.friends.find(byId)
  if (result) res.json(result)
  else res.status(404).end()
})
```

And finally start listening to accept incoming requests.
```js
const server = app.listen(3000, function () {
  const {port} = server.address()
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`)
})
```
