# Putting It All Together
Our app has been split into two: front-end and back-end.

- The **front-end** requires a series of build steps to lint, test, and transpile our HTML/CSS/JS source code.

  Location: `/frontend`

- The **back-end** is a web service that runs continuously and also serves the front-end assets from the *dist* folder.

  Location: `/backend`

We also have two environments: **development** and **production**.

- During development we want to make our lives easier by exposing a debugging interace and watching for source code file changes to automatically re-run the build, lint, and other steps.
- The production environment is deployed to our public web server. We want to create as lean an environment as possible to achieve optimal performance.

## Starting and configuring the application
Using **NPM** and the `scripts` field of the `package.json` file, we have declared all the necessary command line instructions. This allows us to customise the build tool chain while maintaining a simple, consistent interface.

### Development Environment
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Environment
```bash
npm start
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)
```bash
npm test
```
**Note:** The CI build runs on cloud services like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Codeship](https://codeship.com/), or [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/). They help teams collaborate and act as a final check to prevent deploying broken builds.

## Creating database tables

For this MVP we can simply load data from a JSON file.
```js
import database from './database.json'
```

See: [database.json](./backend/database.json)

The database **schema** defines the structure of the database contents. Each Friend object has two properties of a specific type.

```js
{
  id: Number,
  name: String
}
```

## Building the controller

The [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework builds upon Node.js' built-in `http` module. It offers the routing capability we need to implement the RESTful APIs.

```js
import express from 'express'
const app = express()
```

Then let's set up some routes. Listing out all friends:
```js
app.get('/friends', (req, res) => {
  res.json(database.friends)
})
```

Looking up a specific friend:
```js
app.get('/friends/:id', (req, res) => {
  const byId = ({id}) => id === +req.params.id
  const result = database.friends.find(byId)
  if (result) res.json(result)
  else res.status(404).end()
})
```

And finally start listening to accept incoming requests.
```js
const server = app.listen(3000, function () {
  const {port} = server.address()
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

## Building the views
Express can serve the built front-end HTML/CSS/JS assets from the `dist` folder using the `static` middleware.
```js
app.use(express.static('dist'))
```

In `frontend/index.html` let's set up some user interface elements for our front-end app.

```html
<main>
  <h1>Everyone's Friends</h1>
  <ul id="friends"></ul>
  <button id="reload">Reload</button>
</main>
```

Move the `script` tag to the end of the HTML document. This ensures the DOM has been parsed and when the JavaScript code runs. It also improves load performance, an important factor in more complex web pages.

Then in `frontend/app.js` let's implement the API call from the front-end to the back-end:
```js
import babel from 'babel/polyfill'

document.querySelector('#reload')
  .addEventListener('click', async event => {
    const response = await fetch('./friends')
    const friends = await response.json()
    for (const {id, name} of friends) {
      const listItem = document.createElement('li')
      listItem.innerText = name
      listItem.dataset.id = id
      document.querySelector('#friends')
        .appendChild(listItem)
    }
  })
```
