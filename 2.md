# The Front End
Let's have a look at a simple web site and make some changes. Along the way we'll get more familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Introduction to HTML

### What is HTML?
Hyper-Text Markup Language, or **HTML**, is considered a **markup language** rather than a **programming language** because it is logic-less. It describes a document rather than instructing the computer to perform operations.

Most programming languages are very strict. A single wrong space, misplaced semicolon, or unclosed parenthesis can break the entire programme. By contrast, HTML is a forgiving language. Almost no HTML document is 100% compliant with the official HTML standard. This works because the standard defines how browsers should interpret invalid HTML, and most of the time the browser's result matches the author's intent.

### Elements and Tags
Content, like text or images or videos, is structured into HTML elements. The HTML standard defines a set of elements that represent different content types. Elements mark-up content by surrounding it in **tags**. Most elements have an opening and closing tag. Tags are wrapped in angle brackets. The closing tag contains a forward slach (`/`).
```html
<p>This is a paragraph element containing some text.</p>
```

Some elements are self-closing because they do not contain content. They omit the closing tag. Here we see the horizontal rule (`hr`) and line break (`br`) self-closing tags.
```html
<hr>
<br>
```

### Attributes
Opening and self-closing tags may contain one or more named attributes. The available attributes depend on the specific HTML element.

All attributes have a name. Most have a value that must be wrapped in quotes if it contains spaces.
```html
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="My favourite photo">
```

Some attributes have no specific value, only a name. Their presence, or lack thereof, acts as a boolean value.
```html
<button disabled>You can't click me!</button>
<input type="checkbox" checked>
```

### Nested Elements
Elements with start and end tags can contain other elements. While HTML is a forgiving language, you will end up with difficult to understand HTML code if care is not taken to close nested elements in the correct order that they were opened.
```html
<p>
  <b>This is bold</b>, and <u>this is underlined</u>.
</p>
<p> <b>But <u>what</b> about</p> this?</u> ... oh dear!
```

**Tip:** Repeated whitespace (i.e. spaces, tabs, and line breaks) is collapsed by the browser into a single space. Self-discipline is key to writing tidy, maintainable code.

**Protip:** Lazy (read: efficient) programmers use tools called linters to detect potential mistakes and assist with code formatting.

### Named Characters
Because some characters have a special meaning, like angle brackets, a problem arises when the document contains them as content. Imagine writing a document about HTML: How will the browser know which tags are part of the HTML markup and which are merely example code snippets?

The solution is to **escape** these special characters using ampersand notation.
- `&lt;` for `<` (less-than)
- `&gt;` for `>` (greater-than)
- `&amp;` for `&` (ampersand)

This way we can include example code in actual tags.
```html
<p>The &lt;p&gt; tag is for text.</p>
```
Output:
```
The <p> tag is for text.
```

### Comments
Comments are a special pair of tags tells the browser to skip any content contained within.
```html
<!-- This is a comment. The browser does not display it. -->
```

### Document
The HTML standard has been around for decades. Over time changes continue to be made, resulting in several versions of HTML. HTML documents first declare a **doctype** to indicate which version of HTML is being used. For HTML 5, the current standard, it is simply:
```html
<!doctype html>
```

A document then begins with its root element. There can be only one root element and it is always the `html` element.
```html
<html>
</html>
```

The document continues with two structural elements: the `head` element and the `body` element. The head contains meta information about the document, while the body contains the actual content that is displayed on screen.
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My little web page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Here's my picture:
      <img src="me.png" alt="That's me!">
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```
