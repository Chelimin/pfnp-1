# Introduction

## What is programming?
Telling a computer to do something. Complex tasks are explained to the computer in a step-by-step manner. These steps are called an **algorithm**. When performed from start to finish they are said to be **executed**.

An analogy is preparing a meal. A recipe is a programme. The cook is the computer.

Programmes accept **input** and return **output**. For example a search engine can take a text query as input and produce a list of search results as output.

A recipe takes food ingredients as input, and outputs a delicious meal based on them. Different ingredients result in a different meal, despite following the same steps.

Programmes can call other programmes as a form of **abstractions**. By referencing a complex series of operations as a programme, we hide the implementation details.

A recipe may call for greasing a pan, leaving the exact method up to the cook: using butter, olive oil, or cooking spray.

Since each programme is an **encapsulation** of a task, we can quickly create more and more complex programmes through composition. Each step up

For example a recipe contains a series of complex steps, but is itself only a single step in the organisation of a fancy dinner, which in turn is only a single step in a birthday party.

Programmes can also call themselves, which is called **recursion**. For example a recipe to make yoghurt may require an existing yoghurt starter to grow the new culture.

To ensure the programme was written correctly, **automated tests** are written. These expect certain behaviour from the programme and warn the programmer if any deviation is found. In the cooking analogy this could be a simple taste test.

## The different coding languages and how they fit

### Increasing Complexity
Computers are fundamentally mechanical machines with lots of programmable switches. Early computers were massive because they used bulky components. Their programmes were primitive because there were simply not many components involved.

Switches can be open or closed, two states, which is why computers are called binary. Each switch is a bit. A byte is 8 bits and a megabyte is 8 million bits.

Modern computers contain many orders of magnitude more switches, thanks to tiny transistors. Today billions of transistors can fit in a chip the size of a fingernail. The rate of increasing density of these transistors has been observed to grow exponentially, roughly doubling every 2 years, and is called **Moore's Law**.

To harness the power of such complex machines, equally complex programmes are created through abstractions and encapsulation, enabling functionality unimaginable just decades ago.

### Low Level Languages
Programming languages are considered **low level** when they deal with concepts closer *to the metal*. For example activating specific instructions within a processor or allocating and releasing memory space for data.

Low level languages are designed for high-performance computing but come at a cost of programming complexity. Sometimes they are used for performance-critical sections of an application where implementations can be tuned for specific processors or platforms.

Assembly:
```assembly
mov [02h], 'H'
mov [04h], 'e'
mov [06h], 'l'
mov [08h], 'l'
mov [0ah], 'o'
mov [0ch], ','
mov [0eh], 'W'
mov [10h], 'o'
mov [12h], 'r'
mov [14h], 'l'
mov [16h], 'd'
mov [18h], '!'

; color all characters:
mov cx, 12  ; number of characters.
mov di, 03h ; start from byte after 'h'

c:  mov [di], 11101100b   ; light red(1100) on yellow(1110)
    add di, 2 ; skip over next ascii code in vga memory.
    loop c
```

### High Level Languages
High level languages are designed to make it easier to programme complex applications. They introduce **primitives** to work with complex data more easily. For example text, lists, dates. This is in contrast to dealing directly with arbitrary bits and bytes.

The concept of a higher level language is relative. To a C++ programmer the JavaScript language is high level. But to an Assembly programmer the C++ language is high level.=

JavaScript:
```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

### Domain Specific Languages
Niche use-cases sometimes call for new languages that lend themselves even more to very specific tasks, at the cost of not being generally suitable to most other tasks.

For example generating HTML for user interfaces in web applications can be tedious in JavaScript, so web developers often use templating languages instead.

JavaScript:
```js
function createPhoto(url, description) {
  const photo = document.createElement('img')
  photo.src = url
  photo.alt = description
  return photo
}
```

Handlebars:
```html
<img src="{{url}}" alt="{{description}}">
```

## Back end vs Front end

### Client-Server Model
On the web, the most common flow of information is called the **client-server model**.

The client device runs a web browser, or **user agent**. The user agent does not share information with other user agents. It only sends requests for content, called **resources**, to a **web server**.

The web server sends a **response** to the request. Conversely, the web server does not send requests to user agents.

### Front End Programming
Programmes that are executed by a user agent are called the front end.

Web browsers support open standards like HTML, CSS, SVG, and JavaScript. Programming front end applications typically means writing programmes in those languages.

Front end programming focuses on design and usability. Complex front end programmes consist of many different user interfaces, let the user work with large volumes of data, or contain rich visual effects and animations.

Challenges in front end engineering are the ability to write programmes that work in different web browsers, work smoothly on all sorts of devices with high or low power, large or small screens, and automatically testing code for bugs.

### Transpilation
There are many languages that can be automatically translated, or **transpiled**, into JavaScript. This allows the use of different programming languages while still executing JavaScript code in the web browser.

Coffee Script:
```coffeescript
square = (x) -> x * x
```
JavaScript:
```js
square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
};
```

## Back End Programming
A web server is a machine running 24/7 and serves resources for a particular web site to all clients.

The concerns for back end programmers are very different from front end programming. There is a high emphasis on performance, reliability, and security.

### Performance
To handle large numbers of concurrent requests, web servers are **scaled** either **horizontally**, by adding more processors or servers to share the workload, or **vertically**, by using faster computers and more efficient programmes.

Some programming languages and frameworks make this easier to achieve than others. For example Go is a language very well-suited at horizontal scaling because of its concurrency support. Node.js, a JavaScript engine for back end programming, is designed for high performance, asynchronous programming. Languages like C or C++ allow more efficient code, but are unsuitable for most web applications due to their low level primitives.

### Reliability
When a front end application has an error, only one user is affected. But the back end going down could be catastrophic for all users.

Back end programming typically involves building redundant systems. When one programme crashes, another takes over. This can be extended to entire web servers, data centres, or even geographic areas.

Redundancy is also key to ensuring data survives disastrous hardware failure. Copies of data is kept on multiple servers, in several places around the world.

### Security
Building secure programmes means using trusted libraries and frameworks. These are often full of mathematics and information theory. Young programming languages may come with immature libraries or frameworks that have not yet stood the test of time.
